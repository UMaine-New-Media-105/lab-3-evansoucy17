Example One- https://editor.p5js.org/evansoucy17/sketches/FYM08LyBV
I created my own abstract shape made up of different elements
and change its color based on three different conditions using if-else statements. 

Example Two- https://editor.p5js.org/evansoucy17/sketches/66jgVHZK9
I moved my abstract shape into a function with the if-else statements.

Example Three-https://editor.p5js.org/evansoucy17/sketches/66jgVHZK9
I modified the above function to accept parameters that change things inside if-else statements.
